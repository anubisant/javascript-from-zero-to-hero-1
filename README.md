## About

This repository contains the ••source code** and **starter files** of 
[JavaScript: from Zero to Hero](https://zerotoherojs.com).

It’s a work-in-progress, and it’ll be finalized and tagged once the course is
finalized.

## The “Zero to Hero” Community

For news, updates, and important information about the courses;
and to discuss things and get in touch with like-minded learning enthusiasts
[**Join the “Zero to Hero” Spectrum Community][community].

The [**“Zero to Hero” Spectrum Community][community]
is free for **anyone** to join.

When there is an important news to be shared, instead of polluting your email
inboxes, I’ll create a post in the [**“Zero to Hero” Spectrum Community][community]
instead.

I **hate** SPAM with passion and I never send useless junk to your inboxes. 

## About the Folder Structure of This Repo

The folders are grouped into “sections” and “episodes”. Every “episode” corresponds
to a specific video lesson.

Each folder contains the **completed work** that you’ll achieve by the end of that
lesson.

Let me explain it with an example; it’ll be clearer:

* If you are looking for the completed work for “S04E02: Configuring Prettier 
  for Visual Studio Code”, then you’ll find it inside the folder `./S04/E02`.
* IF you want the **starter files** for “S04E02: Configuring Prettier for 
  Visual Studio Code”, then it is one folder before in alphabetical order,
  which will be: `./S04/E01`. 

Before I launch the course, I’ll go through each of those folders one-by-one
following the videos, to clarify things, and fix errors, if any.

I may also add, important side-notes as **README**s into those folders.  

## Contributions and PRs

Since the code in the repo needs to stay in sync with the videos, I typically do
not accept PRs. Though, [you are welcome to create an issue][issue], and we
can discuss it further there.
