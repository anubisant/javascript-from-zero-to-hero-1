## Boring Copyright Stuff

### Bottom Line Up Front

I hate legal stuff: Please don’t make me write more.

Be a good citizen: Use this code for your **own** good **only**.

### At a Glance

- You ARE allowed to keep this package for your **personal** reference.
- You ARE allowed to share it with your peers (*dude(tte), this is a public repo*).
- For “fair use” you don’t have to ask for my permission.
- When in doubt, ask for my permission.

### Examples of Fair Use

**Fair use**:

- Copying parts of the code to your blog and add a link back to <https://zerotohero.dev/>,
  and clearly stating where you got the source code from (*i.e., giving a 
  proper attribution*)

**Unfair use**:

- Copying all the code, putting it into a book, and selling the book.

I trust, if you are interested in [JavaScript: from Zero to Hero](https://zerotohero.dev/),
you are smart enough to realize what’s fair and what’s not and you don’t need
no pep talk about it—but when in doubt, [**please ask me first**](mailto:volkan.io).

### Details

To make lawyers happy, I’d like to explain what “Fair Use” in the above context
means.

what I mean by “Fair Use” is the “Fair Use” as described 
in “*U.S. Code › Title 17 › Chapter 1 › § 107 > Limitations on exclusive rights:
Fair use*”.

I’m sure, you get the gist of it.

But to elaborate:

Fair use is a legal doctrine that says you can reuse copyright-protected
material under certain circumstances without getting permission from the
copyright owner.

#### The Four Factors of Fair Use

In the United States, fair use is determined by a judge, who analyzes how each
of the four factors of fair use applies to a specific case.

1.  The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of
    commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes

Courts typically focus on whether the use is “*transformative*”. That is,
whether it adds new expression or meaning to the original, or whether
it merely copies from the original. Commercial uses are less likely to be
considered fair.

2.  The nature of the copyrighted work

Using material from primarily factual works is more likely to be fair than
using purely fictional works.

3.  The amount and *substantiality* of the portion used in relation to the
    copyrighted work as a whole

*Borrowing small bits of material* from an original work is more likely to be
considered fair use than borrowing large portions. **However**, even a small 
taking may weigh against fair use in some situations if it constitutes 
the “*heart*” of the work.

4.  The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the
    copyrighted work.

Uses that harm the copyright owner’s ability to profit from his or her original
work are less likely to be fair uses.
