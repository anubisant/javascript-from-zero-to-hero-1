Not much change since the last lesson, because this lesson was mostly about
configuring our IDE.

You can check the **lesson notes** that you can find on the videoâ€™s web page
for more information about all the **plugins we used** and 
**configurations we made** to make [Visual Studio Code][code] serve our needs.
