## Installing `yarn`

We use `yarn` to install dependencies to our project in this
example.

[Follow the instructions relevant to your operating system][yarn] to install `yarn`.

[yarn]: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

> **Note**
>
> The examples here use the [**classic** version of `yarn`][yarn].
>
> If you feel adventurous, [you can try using the current version too][yarn-next].
>
> It should not make too much of a difference in our examples, and things should
> work just fine in either version of `yarn`.
